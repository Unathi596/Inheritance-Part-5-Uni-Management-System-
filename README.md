## Visual Basic Project! #
# A University Management System that manages every student information using object-oriented programming:
1. Such as the course name that the student is doing
2.   Course Code
3.   ID
4.   Student Name and Age

   ***All of this is displayed on the *UJGrid* and on the *Multiline TextBox****

     Concepts:
     1. Abstraction
     2. Encapsulation
     3. Inheritance
     4. Composition
     5. Shared Variables

  # Improvements!
  1. Calculating the Semester Mark of each student
  2. Number of Modules on each course (Including Module Information)
  3. Error Handling
  4. Exception Handling
  5. Polymorphism
  6. Determine whether the student is qualifying for the exam using interfaces
  7. Store all information of the student in a single array (Upcasting/Downcasting)

     # Let's put in the Work!
